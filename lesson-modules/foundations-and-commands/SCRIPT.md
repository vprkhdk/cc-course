## How This Course Works

This is an interactive course — Claude guides you through each chapter step by step. Here are the commands you'll use:

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cc-course:start N` | Begin a module (1-5) |
| `/cc-course:continue` | Signal you're done with the current step and ready to move on |
| `/cc-course:hint` | Get help when you're stuck on a task |
| `/cc-course:status` | Check your overall progress across all modules |
| `/cc-course:validate` | Verify your work at the end of a module |
| `/cc-course:submit` | Package your completed work for instructor review |

**The flow**: Claude presents a concept → checks your understanding → gives you a hands-on task → you do it → Claude verifies → repeat. Use `/cc-course:continue` to tell Claude you're ready for the next step.

## Chapter 1: What is Claude Code?

**Chapter ID**: `1.1-what-is-claude-code`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.1](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-11-what-is-claude-code) for detailed explanations of agentic execution, terminal-native advantages, and external resources.

### Content

Claude Code is an agentic coding assistant that runs in your terminal. Unlike chat-based AI tools:

- **Terminal-native**: Works where you already work
- **Full codebase awareness**: Reads and understands your entire project
- **Agentic execution**: Can read files, write code, run commands
- **Memory persistence**: Remembers context across sessions via CLAUDE.md

**Mental model**: Think of Claude Code as a pair programmer who lives in your terminal and never forgets what you told them about your project.

### Key Differences from Other Tools

| Feature | Claude Code | Copilot/Cursor |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Interface | Terminal | IDE plugin |
| Scope | Full codebase | Current file/context |
| Execution | Can run commands | Suggestions only |
| Memory | CLAUDE.md persistence | Session only |

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand the key differences between Claude Code and other AI coding tools (like Copilot/Cursor)? The main points are: terminal-native, full codebase awareness, agentic execution, and memory persistence."
- **Options**: "Yes, I understand — let's continue" / "I have a question" / "I need more explanation"
- On questions: answer them, then re-ask
- On "need more explanation": elaborate on the agentic execution model and CLAUDE.md persistence, then re-ask

### Checklist

- [ ] Understand what "agentic" means in the context of coding assistants
- [ ] Know the key differences between Claude Code and Copilot/Cursor
- [ ] Understand the "pair programmer in terminal" mental model

---

## Chapter 2: Installation & Authentication

**Chapter ID**: `1.2-installation`

> ⚠️ **Prerequisite**: You should have already completed the [Installation Guide (PDF)](./installation-guide.pdf) before starting this interactive course.

If you haven't installed Claude Code yet, please complete the PDF guide first, then return here.

### Quick Verification

Confirm your installation is working:

```bash
claude --version    # Should show version number
claude /doctor      # Should show all checks passing
```

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Since you're already in a Claude Code session right now, your installation is working. Can you confirm that `/doctor` showed all checks passing when you set up?"
- **Options**: "Yes, all good" / "I had some issues" / "I haven't checked"
- On issues: help troubleshoot before proceeding
- On "haven't checked": note it but proceed since they're clearly running Claude Code

### Checklist

- [ ] Claude Code installed globally via npm
- [ ] `claude --version` returns a version number
- [ ] Successfully authenticated (first session works)
- [ ] `/doctor` shows all checks passing

---

## Chapter 3: Basic CLI Interactions

**Chapter ID**: `1.3-cli-basics`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.3](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-13-cli-basics) for detailed execution modes, tool visibility, and CLI cheat sheets.

### Content

#### Starting a Session

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claude` | Interactive mode (recommended for learning) |
| `claude "prompt"` | One-shot mode (run and exit) |
| `claude -p "prompt"` | Print mode (output only, no interactive) |
| `claude -c` | Continue last conversation |

#### Inside a Session

- Type naturally - Claude understands context
- Use `/` to access slash commands
- Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel current operation
- Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D` to end session

#### Reading Claude's Output

Claude shows what tools it's using:
- `Reading file...` - Examining your code
- `Writing file...` - Making changes (asks permission)
- `Running command...` - Executing shell commands (asks permission)

### Practice Exercise

1. Start interactive mode: `claude`
2. Ask: "What files are in the current directory?"
3. Ask: "What is the main purpose of this project?"
4. Exit the session

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand the three ways to run Claude Code? (`claude` for interactive, `claude \"prompt\"` for one-shot, `claude -p \"prompt\"` for print mode)"
- **Options**: "Yes, clear" / "Can you explain the difference again?"
- On "explain again": clarify that interactive is for back-and-forth, one-shot runs and exits, print mode outputs text only (useful for scripts/piping)

### Security: Protecting Sensitive Files

#### Why This Matters

Claude Code can read any file in your project. Without protection, it could read `.env` files containing API keys, certificates, or credentials. Claude Code provides several layers of security to prevent this.

#### Layer 1: `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json` (Primary)

The official way to block Claude from reading sensitive files is `permissions.deny` in your project's `.claude/settings.json`. Rules follow [gitignore pattern syntax](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#read-and-edit):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./*.pem)",
      "Read(./*.key)",
      "Read(./credentials.json)",
      "Read(./service-account*.json)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Pattern reference:**

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `Read(./.env)` | `.env` in project root |
| `Read(./.env.*)` | `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc. |
| `Read(./secrets/**)` | Everything under `secrets/` recursively |
| `Read(./*.pem)` | All `.pem` files in project root |
| `Read(~/.ssh/*)` | SSH keys in home directory |

> **Important caveat**: `Read` deny rules block Claude's built-in Read tool but do NOT prevent `cat .env` via Bash. For full protection, also enable sandboxing (Layer 2).

#### Layer 2: Sandbox (OS-Level Enforcement)

The sandbox provides filesystem and network isolation that also blocks Bash subprocesses:

- Enable with `/sandbox` command in a session
- Restricts what files Bash commands can access
- Combines with `permissions.deny` for defense-in-depth

#### Layer 3: PreToolUse Hooks (Automated, Module 3 Preview)

In Module 3, you'll learn hooks — event-driven automation. A `PreToolUse` hook can automatically block reads with feedback to Claude:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Read",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "if echo $INPUT | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | grep -qE '\\.(env|pem|key)$'; then echo 'Blocked: sensitive file' >&2; exit 2; fi"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Security Layers Comparison

| Layer | Blocks Read tool | Blocks `cat` via Bash | Setup |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| `permissions.deny` | Yes | No | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Sandbox (`/sandbox`) | Yes | Yes | Enable in session |
| PreToolUse hook | Yes | No | `.claude/settings.json` (Module 3) |
| `.gitignore` | No | No | Git only — doesn't affect Claude |

**Recommended**: Always configure `permissions.deny` for sensitive file patterns. Enable sandbox for additional Bash-level protection.

#### `.env` Best Practices

- Never hardcode secrets in source files
- Use `${API_KEY}` interpolation in MCP configs (Module 3)
- Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`
- Commit `.env.example` (no real values) as a template for the team
- For CI/CD: use GitHub Secrets, not env files

### Verification

```yaml
chapter: 1.3-security
type: automated
verification:
  checks:
    - file_exists: ".claude/settings.json"
      contains: "deny"
      task_key: create_claudeignore
```

### Instructor: Action

Tell the student:
"Before we set up your project memory, let's secure your project first. We'll add `permissions.deny` rules to your `.claude/settings.json` to prevent Claude from reading sensitive files.

Create or update `.claude/settings.json` in your repository with deny rules for sensitive file patterns:

```json
{
  \"permissions\": {
    \"deny\": [
      \"Read(./.env)\",
      \"Read(./.env.*)\",
      \"Read(./secrets/**)\",
      \"Read(./*.pem)\",
      \"Read(./*.key)\"
    ]
  }
}
```

Add any additional patterns specific to your project (e.g., `Read(./credentials.json)`, `Read(./docker-compose.override.yml)`).

Create the file now and use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when done."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

Run this check in the student's repository:

1. **file_exists**: Use Glob to check `.claude/settings.json` exists
2. **content_check**: Use Read to verify it contains `"deny"` with at least one `Read(` pattern

**On failure**: Tell the student what's missing. Wait for {cc-course:continue}, then re-verify.

**On success**: Update progress.json: set task `create_claudeignore` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"create_claude_md"`.

### Checklist

- [ ] Can start an interactive Claude session
- [ ] Understand difference between `claude`, `claude "prompt"`, and `claude -p`
- [ ] Know how to exit a session (`exit` or Ctrl+D)
- [ ] Understand what Claude shows when using tools
- [ ] Configured `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json` to protect sensitive files

## Chapter 4: CLAUDE.md - Your Project's Memory

**Chapter ID**: `1.4-claude-md`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.4](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-14-claudemd--project-memory) for file referencing with `@path`, size optimization strategies, progressive disclosure patterns, and real-world CLAUDE.md examples.

### Content

#### Why CLAUDE.md Matters

Without CLAUDE.md:
```
You: "Where should I add a new component?"
Claude: "I don't have context about your project structure..."
```

With CLAUDE.md:
```
You: "Where should I add a new component?"
Claude: "Based on your project structure, new components go in src/components/..."
```

#### The `/init` Command

Run inside your project:
```bash
claude
/init
```

This auto-generates a CLAUDE.md based on your codebase.

#### CLAUDE.md Structure

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences about what this project does]

## Tech Stack
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript, Python]
- Framework: [e.g., React, FastAPI]
- Testing: [e.g., Jest, pytest]
- Build: [e.g., Vite, Poetry]

## Architecture
[Brief description of codebase organization]

## Conventions
- [Naming conventions]
- [File organization rules]
- [Code style preferences]

## Common Commands
- Run tests: `[command]`
- Start dev: `[command]`
- Build: `[command]`

## Important Context
- [Domain-specific knowledge]
- [Key business logic locations]
- [Sensitive areas]
```

#### How CLAUDE.md Loading Works

Understanding what gets loaded and when helps you keep context lean:

- **CLAUDE.md** is always loaded at session start — its full content counts against your context budget
- **Files referenced by path** in CLAUDE.md (e.g., "See `.claude/rules/design.md` for design specs") are **NOT auto-loaded**. Claude must explicitly Read them when needed.
- **Skills descriptions** from `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` are auto-loaded (just the `description` field, not full content)
- **Best practice**: Keep CLAUDE.md under 500 lines. Put detailed content in supporting files that Claude reads on-demand when relevant.

#### Role-Specific Additions

| Role | Add to CLAUDE.md |
|------|------------------|
| Frontend | React/Next.js component patterns, styling approach (Tailwind/CSS), SSR/SSG strategy |
| Backend | NestJS module/service patterns, Drizzle schemas, auth flow, DTO conventions |
| QA | Test organization, fixtures, coverage requirements |
| DevOps | Infrastructure layout, environments, deployment |
| Marketing | Campaign naming conventions, UTM structure, brand voice guidelines, KPI targets |
| Mobile | Build commands, signing config, app architecture (MVVM), platform conventions, min SDK targets |

### Verification

```yaml
chapter: 1.4-claude-md
type: automated

  checks:
    - file_exists: "CLAUDE.md"
      task_key: create_claude_md

            message: "Contains placeholder brackets - fill in actual values"
      task_key: claude_md_quality
```

### CLAUDE.md Best Practices

Based on official Anthropic documentation:

| Guideline | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Length** | Keep under 500 lines (warn at 300) |
| **Size** | Max 40,000 characters |
| **Sections** | Overview, Tech Stack, Conventions, Commands |
| **References** | Use `@path/to/file` for long files to avoid bloat |
| **Placeholders** | Remove TODO/FIXME before committing |

If your CLAUDE.md exceeds 200 lines, consider:
- Moving detailed specs to separate files (reference with `@docs/api-spec.md`)
- Using `.claude/settings.json` for project-specific settings
- Creating skills in `.claude/skills/` for reusable instructions

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand why CLAUDE.md matters and what sections it should contain? (Overview, Tech Stack, Conventions, Commands)"
- **Options**: "Yes, I understand the purpose and structure" / "I have a question" / "Can you show an example?"
- On "show an example": walk through a concrete CLAUDE.md for their role/stack
- On questions: answer, then re-ask

### Instructor: Action

**DO NOT create or edit CLAUDE.md for the student** — guide them to do it themselves.

#### Step 1: Check if CLAUDE.md Already Exists

Use Glob to check if `CLAUDE.md` exists in the student's repository root.

#### If CLAUDE.md EXISTS:

1. **Read it** and evaluate against the best practices checklist (see KNOWLEDGE.md Chapter 1.4)
2. **Give specific feedback** on what's present and what's missing:
   - Does it have a project overview? Tech stack? Conventions? Commands?
   - Is it under 500 lines? Free of TODO/FIXME placeholders?
   - Does it use `@path` references for long sections?
   - Are file paths and commands accurate?
3. **Tell the student**: "You already have a CLAUDE.md — great! I've reviewed it and here's what I found: [specific feedback]. Please enhance it by [specific improvements needed]."

#### If CLAUDE.md DOES NOT EXIST:

1. **Tell the student** to run `/init` to auto-generate a CLAUDE.md
2. **After they run it**, review the generated file

#### Step 2: Enhance (both paths)

Tell the student to add or improve these sections:
- Project overview (2-3 sentences describing the project)
- Tech stack (language, framework, testing, build tools)
- Conventions (naming, file organization, code style)
- Common commands (test, build, dev server, lint)
- Remove any placeholder text (TODO, FIXME, unfilled `[brackets]`)

Say the appropriate message:
- **If exists**: "I've reviewed your CLAUDE.md and here are my suggestions: [feedback]. Enhance it with the improvements above. Use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when you're done."
- **If not exists**: "Run `/init` in your repository now. Review what it generates, then enhance it with your project's specifics. Use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when you're done."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool before proceeding.**

### Instructor: Verify

Run ALL these checks in the student's repository before marking complete:

1. **file_exists**: Use Glob to check `CLAUDE.md` exists in the repo root
2. **file_contains**: Use Grep to check for Overview/Project section, Tech Stack section, and Conventions section
3. **file_quality**: Use Read to check:
   - File is under 500 lines (warn at 300)
   - No remaining `TODO`/`FIXME` placeholders
   - No unfilled `[bracket]` placeholders
   - Has at least 4 meaningful sections

**On failure**: Tell the student specifically what's missing (e.g., "Your CLAUDE.md is missing a Tech Stack section"). Wait for {cc-course:continue}, then re-verify.

**On success**: Update progress.json: set tasks `create_claude_md`, `add_project_overview`, `add_tech_stack`, `add_conventions`, `claude_md_quality` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"test_claude_understanding"`.

### Checklist

- [ ] Run `/init` in your repository
- [ ] Review and enhance the auto-generated CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Add project overview section
- [ ] Add tech stack section
- [ ] Add conventions section
- [ ] Add common commands section
- [ ] Check CLAUDE.md quality (line count, no placeholders)

## Chapter 5: Testing Your Setup

**Chapter ID**: `1.5-testing-setup`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.5](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-15-testing-your-setup) for expected responses, debugging context loading issues, and using `/context` effectively.

### Content

#### Verification Questions

Ask Claude these questions to verify CLAUDE.md is working:

1. **"What is this project about?"**
   - Claude should describe your project accurately

2. **"What testing framework do we use?"**
   - Claude should reference your tech stack

3. **"Where would I add a new [component/endpoint/test]?"**
   - Claude should know your file structure

4. **"What are the naming conventions in this project?"**
   - Claude should reference your conventions

#### If Claude Doesn't Understand

Common fixes:
- Add more specific examples to CLAUDE.md
- Remove jargon and use concrete terms
- Include actual file paths, not just descriptions
- Add a "Key Files" section pointing to important code

### Verification

```yaml
chapter: 1.5-testing-setup
type: manual
verification:
  questions:
    - "Ask Claude about your project and verify accurate response"
    - "Confirm Claude knows your tech stack"
    - "Confirm Claude understands your file structure"
  task_key: test_claude_understanding
```

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Ready to test your CLAUDE.md by asking me questions about your project? This will show whether the file is working well."
- **Options**: "Yes, let's test it" / "I want to tweak my CLAUDE.md first"
- On "tweak first": let them make changes, wait for {cc-course:continue}

### Instructor: Action

Tell the student:
"Now ask me questions about YOUR project to verify CLAUDE.md is working. Try these:
1. 'What is this project about?'
2. 'What testing framework do we use?'
3. 'Where would I add a new [component/endpoint/test]?'
4. 'What are the naming conventions?'

Ask at least 2-3 of these. If my answers are wrong or vague, that means your CLAUDE.md needs improvement — go back and enhance it."

**Answer the student's questions based on what you can read from their CLAUDE.md.** If your answers are inaccurate, help them identify what to add to CLAUDE.md.

After a few rounds of Q&A, ask: "Are you satisfied with how well I understand your project? Use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when ready."

### Instructor: Verify

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Did Claude answer your project questions accurately based on your CLAUDE.md?"
- **Options**: "Yes, it worked well" / "I improved my CLAUDE.md and it's better now" / "Still needs work"
- On "still needs work": guide them to add more specific info, then re-verify
- On success: update progress.json: set task `test_claude_understanding` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"explore_slash_commands"`

### Checklist

- [ ] Asked Claude "What is this project about?" - got accurate answer
- [ ] Asked about testing framework - Claude knew it
- [ ] Asked where to add new code - Claude gave correct location
- [ ] Claude references information from CLAUDE.md

## Chapter 6a: Discovery Commands

**Chapter ID**: `1.6a-discovery-commands`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.6](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-16-essential-slash-commands) for the complete slash commands reference and CLI flags.

### Content

These three commands help you discover what Claude Code can do and diagnose issues.

#### `/help` — See All Commands

Shows every available slash command, including custom commands you create. This is your go-to when you forget a command name.

#### `/doctor` — Diagnose Issues

Runs health checks on your Claude Code installation. Use it when something isn't working or after updates.

#### `/config` — View and Modify Settings

Shows your current configuration (model, permissions, etc.) and lets you change settings. Useful for checking which model you're using or adjusting permissions.

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand these three discovery commands? `/help` (lists all commands), `/doctor` (diagnose issues), `/config` (view/change settings)"
- **Options**: "Yes, I understand them" / "Can you explain more?"
- On "explain more": elaborate on each command's purpose with examples, then re-ask

### Instructor: Action

Tell the student:
"Now try these three commands yourself:
1. Run `/help` — scan the list, note any commands that look interesting
2. Run `/doctor` — confirm everything is healthy
3. Run `/config` — see your current settings (model, permissions)

Try them now and use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when you've explored all three."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

Try to verify using MCP session search:
1. Use `mcp__cclogviewer__search_logs` or `mcp__cclogviewer__get_session_timeline` to check if the student ran `/help`, `/doctor`, and `/config` in this session
2. **Fallback** (if MCP is unavailable or returns no results): Use AskUserQuestion to confirm: "Did you try /help, /doctor, and /config?"

On success: update progress.json: set task `explore_slash_commands` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"test_session_commands"`

### Checklist

- [ ] Used `/help` to see available commands
- [ ] Used `/doctor` to verify installation
- [ ] Used `/config` to see current settings

## Chapter 6b: Understanding Context

**Chapter ID**: `1.6b-understanding-context`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.6](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-16-essential-slash-commands) for detailed context component explanations and debugging context loading issues.

### Content

#### What `/context` Shows

The `/context` command reveals what's in Claude's "working memory." It displays a component table:

| Component | What It Shows |
|-----------|--------------|
| **System prompt** | Base instructions Claude follows (always present) |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Your project memory file content |
| **Messages** | Conversation history (your prompts + Claude's responses) |
| **Tool results** | Output from file reads, command execution, etc. |
| **Context usage %** | How full the context window is |

#### Context Usage and Performance

Your context usage percentage directly affects Claude's performance:

| Usage | Status | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 0–50% | Optimal | Full performance, plenty of room |
| 50–75% | Good | Working well, monitor if doing large tasks |
| 75–90% | Consider `/compact` | Performance may start degrading |
| 90%+ | Degraded | Use `/compact` or `/clear` immediately |

### Instructor: Action

Tell the student:
"Run `/context` now and look at the output carefully:
- What is your context usage percentage?
- Can you see your CLAUDE.md listed in the components?
- How many messages are in the conversation so far?

Run it now and use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when done."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "What was your context usage percentage when you ran `/context`?"
- **Options**: "Under 50%" / "50-75%" / "Over 75%" / "I'm not sure"
- On any answer: acknowledge the result, explain what it means based on the performance table above
- Do NOT update any task key yet — this is verified together with 6c and 6d

### Checklist

- [ ] Ran `/context` and read the output
- [ ] Know the context usage percentage
- [ ] Can identify CLAUDE.md in the context components

## Chapter 6c: Context Management

**Chapter ID**: `1.6c-context-management`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.6](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-16-essential-slash-commands) for `/clear` vs `/compact` detailed comparison and advanced context management strategies.

### Content

Three tools for managing your context window:

#### 1. `/compact` — Intelligent Compression

Compresses your conversation while keeping essential information. Use when:
- Context is getting full (75%+)
- You want to continue working but need more room
- You're in a long session

**What it preserves**: CLAUDE.md, key decisions, recent messages, file contents referenced.
**What it summarizes**: Older messages, repetitive tool outputs, earlier exploration.

#### 2. `/clear` — Hard Reset

Completely wipes the conversation. Use when:
- Switching to a completely different task
- Claude is confused or hallucinating
- You want a fresh start

**What it preserves**: CLAUDE.md (reloaded on next message), system instructions.
**What it loses**: All conversation history, all tool results, all context.

#### 3. Autocompact — Automatic Protection

When context approaches the limit, Claude Code **automatically compresses** the conversation. It:
- Summarizes earlier messages while preserving key information
- Keeps recent messages and tool results intact
- Happens transparently (you may notice a brief pause)

#### When to Use Each

| Scenario | `/compact` | `/clear` |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Running low on context | Yes — compresses but keeps essentials | Overkill — loses everything |
| Claude is confused | Sometimes helps | Yes — fresh start is better |
| Switching to a different task | Not ideal — old context may confuse | Yes — clean slate |
| Long session, want to continue | Yes — preserves summary | No — you'd lose all progress |
| Want to try a different approach | Maybe — depends on what to keep | Yes — start fresh |

**Power workflow**: Save your plan to a file → `/clear` → reference via `@plan.md` → fresh context with your plan preserved.

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand the difference between `/compact` and `/clear`? (`/compact` compresses but keeps essentials; `/clear` wipes everything except CLAUDE.md)"
- **Options**: "Yes, I understand" / "Can you explain more?"
- On "explain more": walk through the comparison table above with concrete examples, then re-ask

### Instructor: Action

> **IMPORTANT**: Before the student runs `/clear`, save progress to progress.json:
> - `current_module`: `"foundations-and-commands"`
> - `current_task`: `"test_session_commands"`

Tell the student:
"Let's experience `/clear` firsthand — this will demonstrate that your CLAUDE.md and course state survive a full reset.

**Steps:**
1. Run `/clear` now — this wipes the conversation context
2. **Immediately** after the reset, use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool to resume the course

The course tracks your progress in `progress.json` on disk, not in conversation memory. After `/clear`, Claude reloads CLAUDE.md automatically and the course picks up right where you left off."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

After the student returns via {cc-course:continue}, ask a simple confirmation. Do NOT re-run `/context` or loop back to earlier steps — the student just cleared context and doesn't have prior conversation history.

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Welcome back! Did `/clear` work? The key takeaway is: conversation history is gone, but CLAUDE.md reloads and your course progress survived because it's stored on disk."
- **Options**: "Yes, it worked — makes sense" / "I had issues resuming" / "I didn't run /clear"
- On "had issues": check that progress.json exists and has correct `current_module`. If CLAUDE.md didn't reload, suggest running `/init` to re-initialize.
- On "didn't run /clear": encourage them to try it — it's safe and demonstrates an important concept
- Do NOT update any task key yet — verified together with 6d

### Checklist

- [ ] Understand `/compact` (intelligent compression)
- [ ] Understand `/clear` (hard reset)
- [ ] Know about autocompact (automatic protection)
- [ ] Ran `/clear` and verified course state survived

## Chapter 6d: Status Line

**Chapter ID**: `1.6d-statusline`

### Content

#### What `/statusline` Does

The `/statusline` command configures what's displayed in Claude Code's status bar at the bottom of your terminal. This gives you at-a-glance session awareness without interrupting your work.

#### Recommended Items

| Item | Why It's Useful |
|------|----------------|
| **Context %** | Know when you're running low |
| **Model name** | Confirm which model you're using |
| **Git branch** | Stay aware of your current branch |
| **Project name** | Useful when working across multiple projects |

#### When It's Useful

- Long coding sessions where context fills up
- Switching between projects or branches
- Verifying you're on the right model before complex tasks
- Quick context awareness without running `/context`

### Instructor: Action

Tell the student:
"Run `/statusline` and configure your status bar. I recommend enabling at least:
- Context % (most important — shows when you're running low)
- Model name
- Git branch

Settings persist across sessions, so you only need to configure this once.

Run `/statusline` now and use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when you've configured it."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Did you configure your status line with `/statusline`?"
- **Options**: "Yes, I configured it" / "I looked at it but kept defaults" / "It's not working or I don't see it" / "I need help"
- On "need help": walk them through the `/statusline` command step by step
- On "not working": "The status line feature depends on your terminal and Claude Code version. If `/statusline` doesn't respond or nothing appears in the status bar, that's OK — it's a nice-to-have convenience feature, not essential. The key concept is that Claude Code CAN show session info in the status bar. Let's move on."
- On any response (including "not working"): update progress.json: set task `test_session_commands` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"use_plan_mode"`

### Checklist

- [ ] Ran `/statusline` (or attempted it)
- [ ] Understand what the status line shows (context %, model, branch)
- [ ] Understand when the status line is useful

---

## Chapter 6e: Performance Controls

**Chapter ID**: `1.6e-performance-controls`

### Content

#### `/effort` — Control How Hard Claude Thinks

The `/effort` command sets how much reasoning Claude applies to your requests:

| Level | Behavior | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `low` | Quick, concise answers | Simple questions, file lookups, small edits |
| `medium` | Balanced (default) | Most everyday tasks |
| `high` | Deeper reasoning, more thorough | Complex refactoring, architecture decisions |
| `max` | Maximum reasoning depth (Opus 4.6 only) | Hard debugging, multi-file redesigns |

```
/effort high
```

You can also set it via CLI flag:
```bash
claude --effort high
```

**When to change effort:**
- Dropping to `low` for repetitive tasks saves time and tokens
- Raising to `high` or `max` when Claude misses edge cases or gives shallow answers
- The setting persists for the session — change it back when you're done

#### `/fast` — Toggle Fast Mode

`/fast` toggles fast output mode. This uses the **same model** (not a weaker one!) but optimizes for speed:

```
/fast
```

Fast mode is useful when you're iterating quickly and don't need maximum deliberation. Toggle it off when you need Claude to be thorough again.

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask: "When would you use `/effort low` vs `/effort high`? And what does `/fast` actually change?"
- Options: "Low for simple tasks, high for complex ones. Fast = same model, faster output" / "I'm not sure about the difference" / "I want to try them now"

On "want to try": Encourage them to try switching effort levels with a simple vs complex task.

### Checklist

- [ ] Know the 4 effort levels and when to use each
- [ ] Understand `/fast` toggles speed, not model quality
- [ ] Know these are session-scoped settings

## Chapter 6f: Claude Code Everywhere

**Chapter ID**: `1.6f-claude-everywhere`

### Content

Claude Code sessions aren't tied to one device or environment. You can start work in the terminal and continue from your phone, or kick off a task on the web and pull it into your local IDE.

#### Remote Control (`--remote-control`)

Start a session that you can also control from claude.ai or the Claude app on your phone:

```bash
claude --remote-control "My Project"
# or short form:
claude --rc
```

This opens a normal terminal session, but you can also access it from any browser at claude.ai. Useful when you:
- Want to step away from your desk but keep working
- Need to share a session with a colleague
- Want to use the web UI for reviewing diffs

#### Web Sessions (`--remote`)

Kick off a task entirely on Anthropic's cloud:

```bash
claude --remote "Fix all TypeScript errors in src/"
```

The task runs on Anthropic-managed infrastructure — even if you close your laptop. Check back from any device to see results.

#### `/teleport` — Pull Web Sessions Locally

Started a task on the web or mobile? Pull it into your terminal:

```
/teleport
```

This transfers the full session (context, files, changes) to your local environment so you can continue interactively.

#### `/desktop` — Hand Off to Desktop App

Transfer your terminal session to the Desktop app for visual diff review:

```
/desktop
```

The Desktop app shows inline diffs, conversation history, and a visual file tree — useful for reviewing large changes before committing.

#### Summary: Where to Work

| Scenario | How |
|----------|-----|
| Start on laptop, continue on phone | `claude --rc`, open claude.ai on phone |
| Long-running task, close laptop | `claude --remote "task"` |
| Started on web, need local tools | `/teleport` in terminal |
| Want visual diff review | `/desktop` from terminal |
| Multiple sessions side by side | Desktop app or separate terminal tabs |

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask: "Have you ever been in a situation where you wished you could continue your Claude Code work from a different device or environment?"
- Options: "Yes, this would be useful" / "Not really, I work from one machine" / "I want to try remote control"

On "want to try": Walk through `claude --rc` and opening claude.ai in their browser.

### Checklist

- [ ] Know how to start a remote-controllable session (`--rc`)
- [ ] Know how to run tasks in the cloud (`--remote`)
- [ ] Understand `/teleport` for pulling web sessions locally
- [ ] Understand `/desktop` for visual review

## Chapter 7: Plan Mode

**Chapter ID**: `1.7-plan-mode`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.7](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-17-plan-mode) for plan output format, evaluating plan quality, good vs poor plan examples, and plan modification techniques.

### Content

#### What is Plan Mode?

Plan mode makes Claude explain its approach **before** executing. This is useful for:
- Complex refactoring tasks
- Tasks with multiple approaches
- When you want to review before changes happen

#### Entering Plan Mode

- **Keyboard**: Press `Shift+Tab` before sending
- **Explicit**: Add "Plan this first, don't execute" to your prompt

#### Plan Mode Workflow

1. Enter plan mode
2. Describe your task
3. Claude generates a plan (no execution)
4. You review and modify
5. Approve to execute, or refine the plan

#### When to Use Plan Mode

| Use Plan Mode | Skip Plan Mode |
|---------------|----------------|
| Refactoring across files | Simple file edits |
| Adding new features | Quick fixes |
| Architectural changes | Reading/exploring code |
| Unfamiliar codebases | Familiar, small changes |

### Practice Exercise

1. Enter plan mode (`Shift+Tab`)
2. Ask: "Plan how to add [a feature relevant to your project]"
3. Review the plan — ask Claude to modify or improve it (2-3 rounds)
4. Press `Escape` to exit plan mode **without executing**
5. Key takeaway: plan mode is for thinking — you control whether anything gets executed

### Verification

```yaml
chapter: 1.7-plan-mode
type: manual
verification:
  questions:
    - "Enter plan mode and request a plan for a feature"
    - "Review the generated plan without executing"
    - "Identify if Claude understood your codebase from the plan"
  task_key: use_plan_mode
```

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand when to use plan mode vs just asking Claude directly? (Plan mode is best for complex, multi-file changes where you want to review the approach first.)"
- **Options**: "Yes, I understand when to use it" / "Can you give examples?"
- On "give examples": walk through the table of when to use vs skip plan mode

### Instructor: Action

Tell the student:
"Let's try plan mode as a **thinking tool**. I'm about to activate plan mode for this conversation. Here's what will happen:

1. **I'll enter plan mode** — you'll see a plan mode indicator appear
2. **You request a plan**: Ask me to plan a feature for your project — e.g., 'Plan how to add [something relevant to your codebase]'
3. **Iterate on the plan** (2-3 rounds): Give feedback like:
   - 'What about edge cases?'
   - 'Can you split step 3 into smaller parts?'
   - 'What if we used [alternative approach] instead?'
4. **Exit with Escape**: Press `Escape` to exit plan mode **WITHOUT accepting or executing the plan**

The key lesson: plan mode is for **thinking and exploring** approaches. You always control whether anything gets executed.

Ready? I'll activate plan mode now."

**After delivering this message, immediately invoke the `EnterPlanMode` tool.** Do not wait — call the tool in the same turn as the explanation above.

The student will approve the plan mode activation, then interact with you in plan mode. After they press `Escape` to exit, they should use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool to resume the lesson.

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "How did plan mode go? Did you: (1) Request a plan for a feature, (2) Iterate on it with feedback (2-3 rounds), (3) Exit with Escape without executing?"
- **Options**: "Yes, completed all steps" / "I got a plan but didn't iterate" / "I need to try again"
- On "didn't iterate": invoke `EnterPlanMode` again so they can retry with 2-3 rounds of feedback, wait for {cc-course:continue}
- On "need to try again": invoke `EnterPlanMode` again, wait for {cc-course:continue}, then re-verify
- On success: update progress.json: set task `use_plan_mode` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"create_custom_command"`

### Checklist

- [ ] Know how to enter plan mode (Shift+Tab)
- [ ] Generated at least one plan without executing
- [ ] Iterated on a plan (asked for modifications 2-3 times)
- [ ] Exited plan mode with Escape WITHOUT executing
- [ ] Understand when plan mode is appropriate

## Chapter 8: Creating Custom Commands

**Chapter ID**: `1.8-custom-commands`

> 📚 **Deep Dive**: See [KNOWLEDGE.md — Chapter 1.8](./KNOWLEDGE.md#chapter-18-custom-commands) for all frontmatter options, commands with parameters, Skills vs Commands decision tree, and testing commands.

### Content

#### What Are Custom Commands?

Custom commands are project-specific slash commands you define as markdown files. They live in `.claude/commands/` and appear when you type `/`.

Think of them as **saved prompts that encode your team's workflows**. Instead of re-typing the same complex instructions every session, you write them once and invoke with a slash command.

#### Why Custom Commands?

**The problem**: You find yourself giving Claude the same multi-step instructions repeatedly — "review the diff using our style guide", "scaffold a component following our patterns", "run the deploy checklist". Every new session, you re-explain the same context.

**Before custom commands** (every session):
```
You: "Review my git diff. Check for: unused imports, console.logs left in,
     functions over 50 lines, missing error handling. Use our team convention
     of descriptive variable names. Format the review as a checklist."
```

**After custom commands** (once, forever):
```
You: /review
```

Same result, zero re-typing. The instructions live in `.claude/commands/review.md` and Claude follows them every time.

#### When to Create a Command

Create a custom command when you notice any of these patterns:

| Signal | Example | Command idea |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **You repeat the same prompt** across sessions | "Scaffold a component with tests" | `/new-component` |
| **Complex multi-step workflow** you always do the same way | "Run tests, check coverage, format report" | `/test-report` |
| **Team conventions** that everyone should follow | "Review PR using our style guide checklist" | `/review` |
| **Onboarding knowledge** that's hard to remember | "Set up local dev environment" | `/setup-local` |
| **Domain-specific tasks** with many details | "Generate API endpoint with auth, validation, and OpenAPI spec" | `/new-endpoint` |

**Don't create a command** for one-off tasks or things that vary too much between uses.

#### Command File Structure

Location: `.claude/commands/[command-name].md`

```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: What this command does (shown in /help)
---

# Instructions

When this command is invoked:

1. [First step Claude should take]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]

# Context

[Any constraints, conventions, or project-specific details]

# Output Format

[How Claude should present results]
```

The frontmatter (`name` and `description`) is required — it's how Claude Code registers the command.

#### Example: A Review Command

`.claude/commands/review.md`:
```markdown
---
name: review
description: Review current changes against team standards
---

# Instructions

1. Run `git diff` to see current changes
2. Check each changed file for:
   - Unused imports or variables
   - Console.log / debug statements left in
   - Functions longer than 50 lines
   - Missing error handling for async operations
3. Verify naming follows project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
4. Output a checklist: one item per issue found, grouped by file
```

Usage: just type `/review` — Claude reads the diff and runs the checklist every time.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Custom commands load at session start. After creating a new command file, you must **start a new Claude session** for it to appear in `/help` and be invokable. Type `exit` then `claude` to restart.

### Practice Exercise

1. Create the commands directory: `mkdir -p .claude/commands`
2. Create a simple command for a task you do often
3. Test it with Claude

**Command Ideas by Role**:

| Role | Command Idea |
|------|--------------|
| Frontend | `/new-page` - Create Next.js page with component, styles, and tests |
| Backend | `/new-resource` - Create NestJS resource (module, controller, service, DTO) |
| QA | `/test-suite` - Generate test suite for a module |
| DevOps | `/new-service` - Scaffold service configuration |
| Marketing | `/creative-brief` - Generate structured creative brief from campaign parameters |
| Mobile | `/new-screen` - Scaffold screen with View + ViewModel + navigation |

### Verification

```yaml
chapter: 1.8-custom-commands
type: automated
verification:
  checks:
    - directory_exists: ".claude/commands"
      task_key: create_commands_directory
    - file_pattern: ".claude/commands/*.md"
      min_count: 1
      task_key: create_custom_command
    - file_contains_frontmatter: ["name:", "description:"]
      task_key: valid_command_format
```

### Instructor: Checkpoint

Ask the student using AskUserQuestion:
- **Question**: "Do you understand the structure of a custom command? (A markdown file in `.claude/commands/` with frontmatter containing `name` and `description`.)"
- **Options**: "Yes, I understand" / "Can you show the structure again?"
- On "show again": re-present the command file structure from the Content section

### Instructor: Action

> **NOTE**: Unlike other ACTION phases where the student must do the work manually, here the student **prompts Claude Code to create the command for them** — that's the core lesson. You (the instructor) ARE allowed to create files when the student asks you to.

Tell the student:
"Now it's time to create your own custom command — but here's the key: **you MUST use Claude Code to create it**. This is a fundamental practice: use Claude Code to build Claude Code configurations.

**Why?** Claude already knows the correct format, frontmatter, and conventions. Prompting Claude to create commands:
- Ensures proper structure (frontmatter, sections)
- Adapts to your project automatically
- Practices the prompting skill you'll use daily

**Your task:**
1. First, create the commands directory: `mkdir -p .claude/commands`
2. Then **prompt me** (Claude) to create a command for you. Here are role-specific prompt examples:

| Role | Example Prompt |
|------|---------------|
| Frontend | 'Create a `/new-page` command that scaffolds a Next.js page with React component, Tailwind styles, and tests in my project structure' |
| Backend | 'Create a `/new-resource` command that generates a NestJS module with controller, service, DTO, and Drizzle schema following my project patterns' |
| QA | 'Create a `/test-suite` command that generates a test suite for a given module' |
| DevOps | 'Create a `/new-service` command that scaffolds a service configuration' |
| Marketing | 'Create a `/creative-brief` command that generates a structured creative brief with audience, messaging, platform specs, and concept directions' |
| Mobile | 'Create a `/new-screen` command that scaffolds a screen with View, ViewModel, and navigation wiring following my project architecture' |

3. After I create it, **review the result**:
   - Does the frontmatter have `name` and `description`?
   - Do the instructions make sense for your project?
   - Would you tweak anything?
4. Test it by running your new command

Prompt me now to create your command. Use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool when you've reviewed and tested it."

**Wait for the student to use the {cc-course:continue} Skill tool.**

### Instructor: Verify

Run these checks in the student's repository:

1. **directory_exists**: Use Glob to check `.claude/commands/` directory exists
2. **file_pattern**: Use Glob for `.claude/commands/*.md` — at least 1 file must exist
3. **frontmatter_check**: Use Read to verify the command file has frontmatter with `name:` and `description:`

**On failure**: Tell the student specifically what's missing:
- No directory? → "Run `mkdir -p .claude/commands` first"
- No files? → "Create a markdown file in `.claude/commands/`"
- No frontmatter? → "Add `---` delimiters with `name:` and `description:` at the top"

Give the student a brief review of their command — what's good, what could be improved.

Wait for {cc-course:continue} after fixes, then re-verify.

**On success**: Update progress.json: set tasks `create_commands_directory`, `create_custom_command`, `valid_command_format` to `true`, set `current_task` to `"commit_work"`

### Checklist

- [ ] Prompted Claude Code to create a custom command
- [ ] Created `.claude/commands/` directory
- [ ] Created at least one custom command file
- [ ] Reviewed the command: frontmatter, structure, instructions
- [ ] Tested the command with Claude

---

## Module Completion

### Instructor: Final Validation

After Chapter 9 is complete, tell the student:

"You've finished all the chapters! Let's validate your work and package it for submission.

**Step 1 — Validate**: Run the {cc-course:validate} Skill tool now. This checks that all required files exist, your CLAUDE.md meets quality standards, and your work is committed."

**Wait for the student to run validate.** If validation fails, help them fix issues and re-run.

**After validation passes**, tell the student:

"All checks passed!

**Step 2 — Submit**: Run the {cc-course:submit} Skill tool to package your work into a submission archive. This bundles your CLAUDE.md, custom commands, progress data, and session logs for instructor review."

**Wait for the student to run submit.**

After submission completes or if the student declines, proceed to the Seminar Summary below. Note: validation is required to unlock the next module. Submission is optional but recommended.

---

### Next Seminar Preview

In **Seminar 2: Skills**, you'll learn to create reusable instruction files that teach Claude your team's specific patterns and procedures.

---

## Session Export (Post-Completion)

After completing this seminar, you can export your session logs for review or portfolio purposes.

### Export Workflow

When module validation passes, the course engine offers to:

1. **Export session logs** to `exports/seminar1-session-{uuid}.json`
2. **Export summary stats** to `exports/seminar1-summary-{uuid}.json`
3. **Generate HTML report** (optional) for visual review

### Export Commands (via MCP cclogviewer)

The course engine uses these MCP calls:

```
mcp__cclogviewer__get_session_logs(
  session_id="<your-session-id>",
  output_path="./exports/seminar1-session.json"
)

mcp__cclogviewer__get_session_summary(
  session_id="<your-session-id>",
