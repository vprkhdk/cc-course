# Claude Code Seminar Series: Complete Curriculum Plan

**Course Philosophy**: Each seminar builds on the previous one. Developers work on their own GitHub repository throughout the course, progressively implementing Claude Code features that match their specific domain (frontend, backend, QA, DevOps, data engineering, etc.).

---

## Seminar 1: Foundations

**Duration**: 90 minutes (60 min lecture + 30 min hands-on setup)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this seminar, participants will:
- Install and authenticate Claude Code in their development environment
- Navigate basic CLI interactions confidently
- Create a CLAUDE.md file that captures their project's context
- Understand how memory persistence works across sessions

### Topics Covered

**1.1 What is Claude Code?**
- Agentic coding assistant vs. chat-based AI
- How Claude Code differs from Copilot/Cursor (terminal-native, full codebase awareness)
- The "pair programmer in your terminal" mental model

**1.2 Installation & Authentication**
- Installing via native installer: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` (or `brew install --cask claude-code`)
- Authentication flow and API key management
- Verifying installation: `claude --version`
- First launch and initial setup wizard

**1.3 Basic CLI Interactions**
- Starting a session: `claude` (interactive) vs `claude "prompt"` (one-shot)
- The `-p` flag for direct prompts without interactive mode
- The `-c` flag for continuing previous conversations
- Reading Claude's responses and understanding tool usage indicators
- Exiting sessions gracefully

**1.4 CLAUDE.md: Your Project's Memory**
- Why memory matters: context persistence across sessions
- The `/init` command and auto-generated CLAUDE.md
- CLAUDE.md file structure and best practices:
  - Project overview and architecture
  - Key conventions and patterns
  - Common commands and workflows
  - Known issues and gotchas
- Memory hierarchy: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (global) vs project-level
- When Claude reads memory files (session start, file changes)

### Live Demo
- Install Claude Code on a fresh environment
- Run `/init` on a sample repository
- Show before/after of Claude's responses with and without CLAUDE.md
- Demonstrate how adding conventions to CLAUDE.md changes Claude's behavior

---

### Practical Task: "Initialize Your Project"

**Objective**: Set up Claude Code for your own repository and create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file.

**Steps for all participants**:

1. **Install Claude Code** on your machine and verify authentication works

2. **Clone or navigate to your chosen repository**
   - This should be a real project you're working on (not a toy example)
   - If you don't have one, fork a popular open-source project in your domain

3. **Run `/init`** and review the auto-generated CLAUDE.md

4. **Enhance your CLAUDE.md** with the following sections:

```markdown
# Project: [Your Project Name]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences describing what this project does]

## Tech Stack
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- Framework: [e.g., React, FastAPI, Gin]
- Testing: [e.g., Jest, pytest, go test]
- Build: [e.g., Webpack, Poetry, Make]

## Architecture
[Brief description of how the codebase is organized]

## Conventions
- [Naming conventions]
- [File organization rules]
- [Code style preferences]

## Common Commands

```

5. **Test your setup** by asking Claude:
   - "What is this project about?"
   - "Where would I add a new [feature relevant to your domain]?"
   - "What testing framework does this project use?"

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Claude Code installed and authenticated
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists in your repository root
- [ ] CLAUDE.md contains at least 5 meaningful sections
- [ ] Claude correctly answers basic questions about your project
- [ ] Commit your CLAUDE.md to a new branch

**Role-Specific Guidance**:

1. **Run these commands** in your repository and document what you learn:
   ```
   /help
   /doctor
   /config
   /cost
   ```

2. **Create a "cheat sheet"** section in your CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## My Claude Code Cheat Sheet
   
   ### Commands I Use Daily
   - [List the 5 most useful commands for your workflow]
   
   ### My Preferred Flags
   - [Document flags you'll use regularly]
   ```

**Part B: Plan Mode Practice (20 min)**

3. **Choose a task** from your actual backlog (something you need to do anyway):
   
   | Role | Suggested Task |
   |------|----------------|
   | Frontend | "Plan how to add dark mode support to the app" |
   | Backend | "Plan how to add request rate limiting to the API" |
   | QA | "Plan how to add integration tests for [critical flow]" |
   | DevOps | "Plan how to add health check endpoints" |
   | Data | "Plan how to add data validation to the pipeline" |

4. **Enter plan mode** (Shift+Tab) and submit your task

5. **Document the plan** Claude generates (don't execute yet):
   - Was the plan appropriate for your codebase?
   - What would you modify?
   - Did Claude understand your conventions from CLAUDE.md?

**Part C: Permission Configuration (10 min)**

6. **Experiment with permission modes**:
   ```bash
   # Try a task with default permissions
   claude "add a comment to the main entry file"
   
   # Observe: What did Claude ask permission for?
   ```

7. **Update your CLAUDE.md** with permission preferences:
   ```markdown
   ## Permission Notes
   - Safe operations in this repo: [list them]
   - Always ask before: [list sensitive areas]
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Used at least 5 different slash commands
- [ ] Generated a plan using plan mode without executing
- [ ] Documented your command preferences in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Understand the difference between permission modes
- [ ] Can explain when to use `-p` vs interactive mode

**Deliverable**: Updated CLAUDE.md with a "Cheat Sheet" and "Permission Notes" section

### Practical Task: "Extend Your Claude Code Setup"

**Objective**: Add at least one hook, explore MCP, and create a custom command.

**Part A: Create a Hook (15 min)**

1. **Create the hooks directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/hooks
   ```

2. **Choose a hook** based on your role:

   | Role | Suggested Hook |

   ```

9. **Identify a repeated workflow** you do weekly:
   - "Check what PRs need my review"
   - "Set up a new feature branch with boilerplate"
   - "Generate a changelog from recent commits"
   - "Run the full test suite and summarize failures"

10. **Create the command** `.claude/commands/[name].json`:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "[your-command-name]",
      "description": "[What this command does]",
      "instructions": [
        "Step 1: [First action]",
        "Step 2: [Second action]",
        "Step 3: [Final action and output format]"

## Seminar 5: Agents

**Duration**: 120 minutes (80 min lecture + 40 min practice)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this seminar, participants will:
- Understand the subagent architecture and when to use it
- Launch and orchestrate parallel agent execution
- Design effective agent delegation patterns
- Apply agent orchestration to their own workflows

### Topics Covered

**5.1 Understanding Subagents**
- What is a subagent? (Isolated Claude instance for subtask)
- Why subagents? (Parallel work, isolation, specialization)
- Subagent vs. single session (trade-offs)
- The "one Claude writes, another reviews" pattern

**5.2 Launching Subagents**
- Implicit subagents (Claude spawns when needed)
- Explicit subagent requests: "Create a subagent to..."
- Subagent configuration and context passing
- Communication between main agent and subagents

**5.3 Parallel Execution Patterns**
- **Pattern 1**: Divide and conquer
  - Split large task into independent subtasks
  - Each subagent handles one subtask
  - Main agent aggregates results
- **Pattern 2**: Specialist agents
  - Different agents for different expertise
  - Code agent + Test agent + Doc agent
- **Pattern 3**: Review agents
  - One agent implements
  - Another agent reviews/critiques
  - Iterate until quality threshold met

**5.4 Agent Orchestration Strategies**
```

**5.5 Git Worktrees for Parallel Development**
- What are git worktrees? (Multiple working directories, one repo)
- Why worktrees + agents? (True parallel file modifications)
- Setting up worktrees:
  ```bash
  git worktree add ../feature-a feature-branch-a
  git worktree add ../feature-b feature-branch-b
  ```
- Running agents in different worktrees simultaneously

**5.6 Agent Communication Patterns**
- Passing context to subagents
- Collecting and aggregating results
- Error handling in multi-agent scenarios
- When to intervene vs. let agents resolve

**5.7 Best Practices for Multi-Agent Work**
- Keep subagent tasks focused and independent
- Provide clear success criteria for each agent
- Use plan mode before launching complex orchestrations
- Monitor token usage (multiple agents = multiple costs)

### Live Demo
- Launch a subagent to write tests while main agent implements feature
- Set up git worktrees and run parallel agents
- Show the "writer + reviewer" pattern in action
- Demonstrate error recovery when a subagent fails

---

### Practical Task: "Orchestrate Your First Multi-Agent Workflow"

**Objective**: Use agents to parallelize a real task in your repository.

**Part A: Single Subagent (15 min)**

1. **Identify a task with clear subtasks**:
   
   | Role | Suggested Task |
   |------|---------------|
   | Frontend | "Add a new feature component" → Code + Tests + Storybook |
   | Backend | "Add new API endpoint" → Handler + Tests + OpenAPI spec |
   | QA | "Create comprehensive test coverage" → Unit + Integration + E2E |
   | DevOps | "Add new service" → Config + Dockerfile + K8s manifests |
   | Data | "Add new data source" → Ingestion + Validation + Documentation |

2. **Launch with explicit subagent delegation**:
   ```
   I need to [your task]. Please:
   1. Use a subagent to [write tests/generate docs/etc.] 
   2. While you [implement the main code]
   3. Then integrate both results
   ```

3. **Observe and document**:
   - How did Claude split the work?
   - Did the subagent context include your CLAUDE.md?
   - How were results integrated?

**Part B: Parallel Execution with Worktrees (20 min)**

4. **Create two worktrees** for parallel work:
   ```bash
   # Create branches
   git checkout -b agent-task-a
   git checkout -b agent-task-b
   git checkout main
   
   # Create worktrees
   git worktree add ../my-project-task-a agent-task-a
   git worktree add ../my-project-task-b agent-task-b
   ```

5. **Open two terminal windows**, one in each worktree

6. **Launch Claude in each** with related but independent tasks:
   - Terminal 1: `claude "Implement [feature A] with tests"`
   - Terminal 2: `claude "Implement [feature B] with tests"`

7. **Let both run** and observe parallel execution

8. **Merge results**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge agent-task-a
   git merge agent-task-b
   ```

**Part C: Design Your Agent Pattern (10 min)**

9. **Document your ideal multi-agent workflow** in CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Multi-Agent Patterns for This Project
   
   ### Pattern: [Name]
   **Use when**: [Scenario]
   **Agents involved**:
   1. Main agent: [Role]
   2. Subagent A: [Role]
   3. Subagent B: [Role]
   
   **Orchestration**:
   [How they coordinate]
   
   ### Commands
   - `/parallel-feature` - Launch parallel implementation + testing
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Successfully used at least one subagent
- [ ] Created and used git worktrees for parallel execution
- [ ] Ran two Claude sessions simultaneously on related tasks
- [ ] Merged parallel work back to main branch
- [ ] Documented your agent pattern in CLAUDE.md

**Deliverable**: 
- At least 2 branches with agent-generated work merged to main
- Updated CLAUDE.md with "Multi-Agent Patterns" section

**6.3 CI/CD Integration Patterns**
- Pre-commit hooks with Claude
- PR validation workflows
- Automated fix suggestions
- Test generation in CI
- Documentation auto-update

**6.4 Headless Mode**
- What is headless mode? (Non-interactive, scripted execution)
- The `--print` flag for scripted output
- The `--output-format json` for programmatic parsing
- Combining with `--max-turns` for bounded execution
- Example: `claude -p "Fix all lint errors" --print --max-turns 10`

**6.5 Multi-Agent Production Patterns**

**Pattern: Continuous Integration Agent**
```
PR Opened
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Review Agent │──→ Posts review comments
└──────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────┐
│  Fix Agent   │──→ Pushes fix commits
└──────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────┐
│  Test Agent  │──→ Adds missing tests
└──────────────┘
```

**Pattern: Issue Triage**
```
Issue Created
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Triage Agent │──→ Labels, assigns, estimates
└──────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ Implementation   │──→ Creates draft PR
│ Suggestion Agent │
└──────────────────┘
```

**6.6 Building Automated Workflows**
- Cron-triggered Claude jobs
- Event-driven automation (webhooks)
- Slack/Discord integration for notifications
- Dashboard for monitoring agent activity

**6.7 Production Best Practices**
- Rate limiting and cost management
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Audit logging for agent actions
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Security considerations for automated agents

### Live Demo

### Practical Task: "Build Your CI/CD Integration"

**Objective**: Create at least one automated workflow using Claude Code in your repository.

**Part A: GitHub Integration Setup (15 min)**

1. **Install the GitHub App**:
   ```
   claude
   /install-github-app
   ```
   Follow the OAuth flow to connect your repository

2. **Verify integration**:
   ```
   "List the open issues in this repository"
   "What PRs are waiting for review?"
   ```

3. **Test basic automation**:
   ```
   "Review the most recent PR and post a comment with your findings"
   ```

**Part B: Create a CI Workflow (20 min)**

4. **Choose a workflow** based on your needs:

   | Role | Suggested Workflow |
   |------|-------------------|
   | Frontend | Auto-review component changes for accessibility |
   | Backend | Auto-review API changes for breaking changes |
   | QA | Auto-generate test cases for new code |
   | DevOps | Auto-review infrastructure changes for security |
   | Data | Auto-validate data schema changes |

5. **Create the workflow file** `.github/workflows/claude-[your-workflow].yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: Claude [Your Workflow Name]
   
   on:
     pull_request:
       paths:
         - '[relevant paths for your domain]/**'
   
   jobs:
     claude-review:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 0
         
         - name: Install Claude Code
           run: curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
         
         - name: Run Claude Analysis
           env:
             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
           run: |
             claude -p "[Your specific review prompt]" \
               --print \
               --max-turns 5 \
               > claude-review.md
         
         - name: Post Review Comment
           uses: actions/github-script@v7
           with:
             script: |
               const fs = require('fs');
               const review = fs.readFileSync('claude-review.md', 'utf8');
               github.rest.issues.createComment({
                 owner: context.repo.owner,
                 repo: context.repo.repo,
                 issue_number: context.issue.number,
                 body: `## Claude Code Review\n\n${review}`
               });
   ```

6. **Add the API key** to repository secrets:
   - Go to Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Part C: Headless Automation Script (10 min)**

7. **Create a utility script** `scripts/claude-[task].sh`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # scripts/claude-lint-fix.sh
   
   # Run Claude to fix all linting issues
   claude -p "Find and fix all linting errors in the codebase. 
   Use our coding standards from CLAUDE.md.
   Commit each fix separately with descriptive messages." \
     --print \
     --max-turns 20 \
     --output-format json > /tmp/claude-output.json
   
   # Parse and report results
   echo "Claude completed with status:"
   cat /tmp/claude-output.json | jq '.status'
   ```

8. **Make it executable and test**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/claude-lint-fix.sh
   ./scripts/claude-lint-fix.sh
   ```

**Part D: Document Your Workflows (10 min)**

9. **Update CLAUDE.md** with workflow documentation:
   ```markdown
